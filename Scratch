for each ant
    for each direction
        weigh theft (does this put us in a position to steal without risk?)
        weigh aggression (does this put us in a position to attack without loss?)
        weigh food (does this put us closer to food?)
        combine weights
    choose the highest weighted direction

weight functions return a value between -1 (holy shit makes it worse) and +1 (goal accomplished), with 0 being no change
weight combination function scales individual weights and adds

theft
    - look for situations where we can get to food before entering attack radius of an enemy
    - the smaller the window, the higher the weight

aggression
    - weigh heavily against options where we die
    - weigh heavily towards options where we kill
    - adjust weight for proximity to enemies

food
    - weigh by proximity to each food, adjusted down by distance


A position has scores for:
    - Defensibility [-1 to +n]
        * Positive if our movement gains kills
        * -1 for certain death
        * More negative the more we require reinforcements
    
Things a move can do:
    - death adjust (-1 or 0)
    - cause other ants to die (0 to +n)
    - bring us closer to friendly ants (Â±?)
    - bring us closer to enemy hill (0 to +1)
    - defend our own hill (-1 to +1)
