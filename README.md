This is my playground.

It's where code gets started before it gets either abandoned or moved
into it's own repo.

Different (likely dead) projects will exist as different branches in
the playground. If a project ever gets big enough that it needs its
own branch, then it's "serious time" and it gets moved out of the
playground.

But 'master' will always be lonely and empty. v\_v
